# üèóÔ∏è Kokoro Build Blueprint ‚Äî Simple & Detailed Guide

This guide explains in clear, step-by-step language how to build Kokoro, our AI anime mental health companion. It lists what to do, which technologies to use, and what to deliver at each stage.

---

## 1. Define What Kokoro Does

**Goals:**

* Chat with users using text or voice.
* Show an anime character that changes expressions.
* Let users track how they feel every day.
* Detect when someone is in crisis and send alerts.
* Reward users with points and fun animations.

**What You Need to Create First:**

1. A simple description of each feature (a one-page document).
2. A list of user actions (like "log in", "send a message", "check mood").
3. Basic sketches of the app screens (made in Figma or on paper).

---

## 2. Choose Your Technologies

We pick tools that work well together and are popular:

* **Mobile App:**

  * Language: JavaScript/TypeScript
  * Framework: **React Native** with **Expo** (lets you build on iPhone and Android easily)
  * Styling: **Tailwind CSS** using the library **twrnc**

* **Anime Character & Animations:**

  * For simple movements: **Lottie** animations (JSON files you can play in React Native)
  * For full 2D character: **Live2D** engine inside a **Unity WebGL** view

* **Chat & AI:**

  * Server: **Node.js** with **Express.js** (handles requests from the app)
  * AI Brain: **OpenAI GPT-4 API** (generates responses based on user input)

* **Voice Chat:**

  * Speech-to-Text (listening): **DeepGram** API
  * Text-to-Speech (speaking): **ElevenLabs** API

* **Mood & Crisis Detection:**

  * A small Python service (runs separately) using **Hugging Face** models (like BERT) to read text and decide if someone is safe or in crisis.

* **Data Storage:**

  * Real-time messages and mood checks: **Firebase Firestore** (NoSQL database)
  * User profiles and journals: **PostgreSQL** database

* **Login & Notifications:**

  * User sign-up and login: **Firebase Auth** (supports phone number, Google, Apple)
  * Push notifications: **Firebase Cloud Messaging**
  * Emergency SMS/WhatsApp alerts: **Twilio** API

* **Infrastructure & Deployment:**

  * Containerize services with **Docker**
  * Host on **AWS ECS** (servers) and use **AWS S3** for storing images and assets
  * Automate builds and tests with **GitHub Actions**

* **Safety & Monitoring:**

  * Track errors: **Sentry**
  * Monitor performance: **Prometheus** + **Grafana**
  * Enforce security rules: **Helmet.js** in Node.js, **CORS** policies

## 3. Build the App Features

### A. Set Up the Mobile App

1. **Initialize** your project: run `expo init kokoro-app`.
2. **Install** Tailwind support: `npm install twrnc`.
3. **Build** login and signup screens using Firebase Auth.
4. **Create** navigation between screens with **React Navigation**.

**Deliverable:** A working app you can open on your phone, where users can create an account and move between screens.

### B. Make the Chat Work

1. **Set up** a Node.js server:

   * Create an Express project: `npm init`, `npm install express`.
   * Add a `/chat` endpoint that accepts user text.
2. **Connect** to OpenAI API:

   * Send user messages to GPT-4 and get replies.
   * Return replies back to the mobile app.
3. **Store** messages in Firestore.

**Deliverable:** When a user types a message, Kokoro replies with AI-generated text, and both messages are saved in the database.

### C. Add the Anime Avatar

1. **Choose** a Live2D model file (from free sources or create one).
2. **Export** it for Unity and build a small WebGL app.
3. **Embed** the WebGL view in your React Native app using **react-native-webview**.
4. **Map** chat sentiment (positive/negative) from OpenAI to avatar expressions via a simple API.

**Deliverable:** The user sees the anime character change expressions in sync with the chat mood.

## 4. Add Advanced Tools

### A. Mood Tracking & Rewards

1. Make a screen where users pick an emoji or slider to show their mood.
2. Save their mood entry in Firestore and show a simple graph of past moods.
3. Every time they log a mood, give them some XP points and unlock a fun Lottie animation.

### B. Crisis Detection

1. When a chat message is received, send it to your Python service.
2. The Python service uses a Hugging Face model to check for crisis language.
3. If the score is high, show a special screen with breathing exercises and ask for permission to alert a friend.
4. If agreed, use Twilio to send an SMS or WhatsApp message to the friend you chose.

### C. Voice Chat & Journals

1. Record user voice and send audio to DeepGram for transcription.
2. Show the transcribed text in chat and process it with GPT-4 like normal text.
3. Convert important messages or voice notes into daily journal entries stored in PostgreSQL.
4. Let users play back AI‚Äôs voice replies using ElevenLabs.

**Deliverable:** Users can speak to Kokoro, see their words in text, get audio replies, and have a private journal history.

## 5. Test & Improve

1. **Write tests** for your code:

   * JavaScript: use **Jest** to check functions.
   * Python: use **PyTest** to validate crisis logic.
2. **Do a security check** with **OWASP ZAP** to find vulnerabilities.
3. **Invite 50‚Äì100 beta users** on TestFlight (iOS) or Google Play Beta to get feedback.
4. **Fix bugs** and refine the UI based on real user comments.

**Deliverable:** A stable, user-approved beta version.

---

## 6. Launch & Support

1. **Publish** to Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
2. **Set up** a simple landing page using **Next.js** on Vercel to explain Kokoro and link to downloads.
3. **Prepare** tutorial videos or in-app tips to help first-time users.
4. **Monitor** errors with Sentry and usage with Mixpanel or Google Analytics.
5. **Offer** support through a chatbot (Zendesk or Freshdesk) and email.

**Deliverable:** Kokoro is live, users are downloading, and support channels are ready.

---

## 7. Grow & Scale

* **Add Premium**: integrate **Stripe** or **Razorpay** for subscriptions.
* **Expand** features like AR filters or VR chat rooms later.
* **Reach out** to schools and companies for bulk licensing.
* **Keep improving** based on analytics and user feedback.

**Outcome:** Kokoro becomes a trusted mental health companion with a growing user base and revenue.
